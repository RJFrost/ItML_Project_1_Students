We've regularly said we have a \"toolkit\" of things that we can use, we generally don't know which ones we'll need, but here you have a pretty simple goal - if it makes it more accurate, it helps. There's not one specific solution here, there are lots of things that you could do. "

Each of the classification output columns (toxic to the end) is a human label for the comment_text, assessing if it falls into that category of \"rude\".
